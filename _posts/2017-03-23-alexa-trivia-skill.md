Whenever learning a new coding skill the documentation always seem scattered or as if there is a million and one ways to do something. Now I know there multiple solutions to every problem but when starting out it can be overwhelming. When starting the learn about writing an Alexa trivia skill, it was probably the easiest coding endeavor I have done. The documentation was clean and clear.  Now of course every learning process is not clear of any hiccups. Made my only mistake by writing my APP_ID variable as a string, but that was my own mistake since it was in the documentation.  I ended up writing a trivia skill called WoW Trivia. It is a short trivia skill with about twenty trivia questions but it was a good starting point.  
The coolest part about this first step was learning how to integrate Amazons Lambda with the Alexa project. Lambda lets you run code without managing a server. You just upload your code and Lambda takes care of the rest. Who knows servers could be a thing of past. There is so much to learn about Lambda and the Alexa project and plan to move on to their fact skills.
