&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever learning a new coding skill, the documentation can feel scattered or unclear on how to get started. Looking back, I know there can multiple solutions to every problem but starting out can be overwhelming.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my Bloc apprenticeship, I chose to write an Alexa trivia skill. It was the easiest coding endeavor I have done. The Alexa documentation was clean and clear. Now, of course, every learning process is not clear of any hiccups. I made my only mistake by not writing my APP_ID variable as a string, but that was my own oversight since it was in the documentation. I ended up writing a trivia skill called WoW Trivia. It is a short trivia skill with about twenty trivia questions but it was a good starting point.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have any interest in Alexa development, I suggest you head over to there [github](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-trivia) and start messing around.  One of easiest projects to learn and a great beginning point for learning anything and everything for the Alexa project.
