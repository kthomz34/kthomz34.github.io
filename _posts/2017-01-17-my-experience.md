Welcome

My experience at Bloc has been great so far.  It has been challenging to learn many languages in an condensed time from HTML/CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, and Ruby/Rails. There are a lot of resources to go through with each language having its own frameworks and libraries to go through. Each language comes with its own difficulties but also a sense of familiarity which helps. 

Mentor Support

Bloc's mentors help you through the process of learning.  They give you dedicated time during the week to work with you to solve problems you have with the projects they have given you. Working step by step to ensure the code you want to write works.  Now there are many solutions to the same problem, so your mentor helps solve it your way.  Step by step they breakdown the problem into pieces to understand. They also provide support through slack, to help stay in contact with your mentor whenever you have a problem.  The support helps push you and create the web applications.

Conclusion

The fast paced learning helps catch you up on industry standards, practices, and thoughts on how to write code.  A lot of information is given to you dive deep into web development.  It has been a great experience so far and plan to see it through. Based on what I have learned and experience gained, it has easily been the best decision I have made.
