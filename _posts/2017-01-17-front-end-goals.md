title: Goals as a Developer

My goals as a developer are short.

* Create easy to use web applications
* Create web applications using clean looking code
* Keep learning how to improve on coding

Keeping the goals short is simple but figuring out how to acheive these goals is the difficult part. I believe though each goal will feed into the next goal creating a circle of completion, with each goal acheiving a bit of the next.
