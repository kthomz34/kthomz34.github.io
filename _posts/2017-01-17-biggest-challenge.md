A lot of challenges came up while trying to learn web development.  Many languages to read up on such as: 

* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* AngularJS
* Ruby/Rails

A particular challenge that came up was the diffculty in remembering the varying syntax from language to language. Luckily there is some familiarity between the languages which helps with the learning curve but while familiar can be still quite difficult to remember the specifics. Although, challenging, the most challenging thing that came up was keeping code the organized and easy to read. 

Each language trys to solve the problem in there own way. The hardest one to keep organized was JavaScript. When wondering where to put code it honeslty feels like anywhere. Now I know there are resources to keep a developer disciplined but does not feel intuitive. AngularJS made this less of problem with the introduction of controllers, directives, and more. Each peice doing its part to keep th code organized, so that the code is not all in one spot looking like a congealed mess. Ruby/Rails organizing everything just as well or even better. It serperates code into models, views, and controllers. Each of these interact with eachother to ensure everything works as a whole. This setup ensures you know where to put code based on what needs to be done. I have found that as I go through each language, the creators and users of the language feel the same way and have created it in way to help organize code to be readable and more easy to write in.
